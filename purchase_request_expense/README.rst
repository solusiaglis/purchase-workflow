Configuration
=============

To use this module:

1. Configure expandable products that can be used in both expenses and purchase requests
2. Set up approval workflows as needed for both processes
3. If using advance clearing features, ensure the hr_expense_advance_clearing module is installed

Note: When creating expenses from purchase requests, the system maintains the link between both documents for proper tracking and reconciliation.

   * Select one or more purchase request lines (only lines with expandable products can be selected)
   * Click on "Create Expense" action
   * The system will generate an expense record with the selected lines
   * The expense will be linked to the original purchase request

Advanced Features
